description: >
  Scope awareness and ambiguity resolution for codebase-wide work. Trigger on: "all X",
  "every Y", "standardize Z", "make all [things] consistent", "update every [element]",
  or any request targeting multiple instances across files. Also triggers on ambiguous
  instructions: "the box", "the button", "bottom right", "add padding", "make it bigger",
  vague spatial/style references, or when multiple elements could match a description.
  Solves large-scope blindness (missing instances when asked to find/fix "all X") via
  Concept Scaffold protocol (semantic definition, pattern inventory, scope boundaries,
  awareness tracker) with mandatory human verification gates. Solves ambiguity resolution
  failure (guessing instead of clarifying) via disambiguation reports covering referential,
  spatial, and implicit value ambiguities. Includes combined workflow for requests with
  both issues. Use alongside app-audit and design-aesthetic-audit skills.

# SCOPE_AND_CONTEXT.md

## Purpose
Solve two critical AI limitations when working with codebases:
1. **Large-scope blindness** — Missing instances when asked to find/fix "all X"
2. **Ambiguity resolution failure** — Guessing instead of clarifying vague instructions

This skill teaches Claude to be "conscious" across large scopes AND actively resolve ambiguities before executing.

# §I — THE TWO PROBLEMS

## Problem A: Large-Scope Blindness

### What Humans Experience
You say: *"Make all the boxes consistent"*

You expect: Claude finds all 23 boxes across 12 files and standardizes them

What happens: Claude updates 8 obvious ones, misses 15, declares "done"

### Why This Happens
**Claude doesn't maintain conceptual awareness across large codebases.**

When processing "all boxes":
- ✗ Treats `<Card>`, `<Panel>`, `<div className="box">` as separate things
- ✗ Processes files sequentially, losing context between them
- ✗ Stops when it runs out of obvious matches
- ✗ Has no internal "I've checked 8/23 boxes" counter

**Root cause:** No persistent mental model of what "box" means across the entire scope.

---

## Problem B: Ambiguity Resolution Failure

### What Humans Experience
You say: *"Place the green box at the bottom right corner"*

You expect: Claude asks which of the 4 green elements you mean, confirms viewport context, checks for collisions

What happens: Claude picks the wrong element, places it in the wrong corner, uses random padding

### Why This Happens
**Claude defaults to "helpful assumptions" instead of clarifying.**

When given ambiguous instructions:
- ✗ Assumes "the green box" = first green element it finds
- ✗ Assumes "bottom right" = bottom-right of first container
- ✗ Ignores existing elements at that location
- ✗ Makes up arbitrary values (15px padding) instead of inheriting patterns

**Root cause:** No protocol for detecting and resolving ambiguity before execution.

# §II — PRE-FLIGHT PROTOCOL

**MANDATORY:** Run this before starting ANY request.

PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

1. Scope Analysis
   Is this a large-scope request?
   ☐ Affects >10 files
   ☐ Targets "all/every" instances of something
   ☐ Requires maintaining concept across codebase
   
   → If YES: Proceed to §III (Large-Scope Protocol)

2. Ambiguity Detection
   Does the instruction contain:
   ☐ Vague references ("the box", "the button")
   ☐ Spatial terms without anchors ("bottom right", "top corner")
   ☐ Style directives without values ("add padding", "make it bigger")
   ☐ Multiple possible interpretations
   
   → If YES: Proceed to §IV (Ambiguity Resolution Protocol)

3. Combined Cases
   ☐ Both large-scope AND ambiguous
   
   → If YES: Proceed to §V (Combined Workflow)

4. Simple Cases
   ☐ Small scope (<3 files) AND unambiguous
   
   → If YES: Proceed with normal execution

**STOP HERE and complete the appropriate protocol before executing.**

# §III — LARGE-SCOPE PROTOCOL

**Use when:** Request involves "all X", "every Y", "standardize Z" across multiple files.

## The Core Problem

When you say "all boxes", you have a **unified mental concept**. Claude doesn't.

**Solution:** Force Claude to build an explicit **Concept Scaffold** before scanning.

---

## Step 1: Build the Concept Scaffold

Before touching ANY code, create these 4 artifacts:

### Artifact 1: SEMANTIC DEFINITION

**Template:**

CONCEPT: [Thing being worked on]

SEMANTIC DEFINITION:
• Core purpose: [what it does in the app]
• Visual signature: [how users see it]
• Functional signature: [how it behaves]
• NOT included: [similar things that don't count]

Example for "Box":
• Core purpose: Visual container that groups related content
• Visual signature: Background, border/shadow, padding
• Functional signature: Wraps children, no interactivity
• NOT included: Buttons (interactive), Inputs (editable), Modals (overlay)

### Artifact 2: PATTERN INVENTORY

**Template:**

PATTERN INVENTORY: [Thing]

Known implementations in this codebase:
1. <Box> component — src/components/ui/Box.tsx
2. <Card> component — src/components/ui/Card.tsx  
3. <div className="container"> — various files
4. <section className="panel"> — legacy files
5. Raw divs: <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">

Recognition rules:
• Has: background + padding + (border OR shadow)
• Context: Contains multiple child elements
• Does NOT have: onClick/onChange/onSubmit (those are interactive elements)

### Artifact 3: SCOPE BOUNDARIES

**Template:**

SCOPE BOUNDARIES: [Thing]

INCLUDE:
• Folders: src/app/*, src/components/*
• File types: .tsx, .jsx
• Contexts: Page layouts, component wrappers

EXCLUDE:
• Folders: src/lib/*, tests/*, node_modules/*
• Files: Email templates, markdown files
• Edge cases: Nested boxes (only count outermost parent)

EXPECTED RANGE: 15-50 instances
(If you find 5 or 200, double-check your recognition rules)

### Artifact 4: AWARENESS TRACKER

**Template:**

AWARENESS TRACKER: [Thing]

Total files in scope: [X]
Files scanned: [Y]
Instances found: [Z]

PROGRESS LOG:
✓ src/app/page.tsx — 2 instances
✓ src/app/dashboard/page.tsx — 5 instances  
⧖ src/app/settings/* — in progress
⬜ src/components/* — not started

STATUS: 12 of 34 files scanned (35%)

---

## Step 2: Present Scaffold for Approval

**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THIS:**

CONCEPT SCAFFOLD COMPLETE

[Display all 4 artifacts]

VERIFICATION QUESTIONS:
1. Does this semantic definition match your mental model?
2. Are there patterns I'm missing?
3. Should I include/exclude anything else?
4. Does the expected range seem right?

Reply 'proceed' to start scan, or provide corrections.

**WAIT FOR HUMAN CONFIRMATION**

## Step 3: Exhaustive Scan (Using the Scaffold)

Now scan with the Concept Scaffold as your filter:

SCANNING IN PROGRESS...

Using recognition rules from Pattern Inventory
Respecting Scope Boundaries
Updating Awareness Tracker in real-time

[Live updates:]
✓ src/app/page.tsx — 2 instances found
  1. Line 23: <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow p-6">
  2. Line 67: <Card>

✓ src/app/dashboard/page.tsx — 5 instances found
  3. Line 12: <Box>
  4. Line 34: <Box>
  ...

[Continue for ALL files]

STATUS: 34/34 files scanned (100%)
TOTAL FOUND: 37 instances

**Output:** Complete numbered list with file paths and line numbers.

---

## Step 4: Human Verification Gate

SCAN COMPLETE

Found: 37 instances across 12 files

BREAKDOWN BY PATTERN:
• <Box> component: 15 instances
• <Card> component: 12 instances
• Raw divs (legacy): 8 instances
• <Panel> component: 2 instances

VERIFICATION NEEDED:
1. Does this match your expectation of "all [thing]"?
2. Any missing that you know of?
3. Any false positives that shouldn't be included?

Attach the full numbered list for review.

Reply with:
• 'confirmed' to proceed
• Specific corrections: "Add src/app/X.tsx line Y"

**WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION**

## Step 5: Execute with Tracking

Only after confirmation:

APPLYING CHANGES...

Target: Standardize all 37 instances to use <Box> component

Progress:
✓ 1/37 — src/app/page.tsx:23 — Updated
✓ 2/37 — src/app/page.tsx:67 — Updated
✓ 3/37 — src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:12 — Already using <Box>
⚠ 4/37 — src/app/dashboard/page.tsx:34 — Exception: nested inside form, skipped
...

FINAL REPORT:
• Total instances: 37
• Successfully updated: 33
• Already correct: 2
• Exceptions: 2 (with reasons)

All changes complete.

---

## Step 6: Concept Drift Detection (Advanced)

Sometimes "all boxes" SHOULD have variations (e.g., primary vs. secondary cards).

**When building Pattern Inventory, flag this:**

PATTERN DIVERGENCE DETECTED

Found 3 distinct pattern groups:
1. Primary cards (white bg, shadow, 24px padding) — 15 instances
2. Secondary cards (gray bg, border, 16px padding) — 12 instances
3. Legacy panels (inconsistent) — 8 instances

INTERPRETATION OPTIONS:
(a) These are ONE concept with drift → standardize all to single pattern
(b) These are THREE intentional variants → standardize within each group
(c) This is a design system → document current state, don't change

Which interpretation is correct?

This prevents accidentally "flattening" intentional design variations.

# §IV — AMBIGUITY RESOLUTION PROTOCOL

**Use when:** Instruction contains vague references, spatial terms, or missing values.

## The Three Ambiguity Types

### Type A: Referential Ambiguity
**Problem:** "The X" could mean multiple things

**Examples:**
- "Move **the button**" ← Which button? (7 on this page)
- "Fix **the green box**" ← Which green element? (4 exist)
- "Update **the form**" ← Which form? (Login, signup, settings?)

### Type B: Spatial/Relational Ambiguity
**Problem:** Position terms lack explicit anchors

**Examples:**
- "**Bottom right corner**" ← Of viewport? Container? Screen? Modal?
- "**Below the header**" ← Immediately below? Or just lower on page?
- "**Next to the button**" ← Left? Right? Above? Below? How much gap?

### Type C: Implicit Pattern Ambiguity  
**Problem:** Style values not specified, should inherit from existing patterns

**Examples:**
- "Add **padding**" ← How much? (Should match app's spacing scale)
- "Make it **rounded**" ← Border radius? (Should match design tokens)
- "Add **a shadow**" ← Which shadow? (Should match other elevations)

---

## Mandatory Disambiguation Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Ambiguity

Scan instruction for these triggers:

**Type A triggers:**
- Definite articles: "the [thing]"
- Possessives: "its position", "their styles"
- Pronouns: "move it", "update them"

**Type B triggers:**
- Spatial terms: top, bottom, left, right, corner, center, above, below, beside
- Without explicit anchors: "viewport", "container", "modal", "screen"

**Type C triggers:**
- Style directives without values: "bigger", "smaller", "padding", "rounded", "shadow"
- Comparative terms: "more spacing", "less prominent"

**If ANY trigger detected → Proceed to Step 2**

### Step 2: Build Disambiguation Report

**Template:**

⚠️ AMBIGUITY DETECTED

Original instruction: "[paste exact instruction]"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TYPE A — REFERENTIAL AMBIGUITIES

1. "[ambiguous reference]" — Found [N] candidates:

   | ID | Element | Location | Details |
   |----|---------|----------|---------|
   | a  | [element 1] | [file:line] | [current state] |
   | b  | [element 2] | [file:line] | [current state] |
   | c  | [element 3] | [file:line] | [current state] |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TYPE B — SPATIAL AMBIGUITIES

2. "[spatial term]" — Possible contexts:

   | ID | Context | Dimensions | Current Occupants |
   |----|---------|------------|-------------------|
   | a  | Desktop viewport | 1920x1080 | [elements at that position] |
   | b  | Mobile viewport | 375x667 | [elements at that position] |
   | c  | Content area | Varies | [elements at that position] |

3. COLLISION DETECTED:
   Existing elements at target position:
   • [Element name] (fixed, z-index X, dimensions)
   • [Element name] (absolute, conditionally visible)
   
   Conflict resolution options:
   a. Place above existing element (adjust position)
   b. Overlay with higher z-index
   c. Push existing element aside
   d. Use alternative position

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

TYPE C — IMPLICIT PATTERN AMBIGUITIES

4. "[style directive]" — No value specified

   Found these existing patterns in codebase:
   
   | ID | Pattern | Usage | Files |
   |----|---------|-------|-------|
   | a  | 8px | Small elements (buttons, tags) | 12 files |
   | b  | 16px | Medium elements (cards, forms) | 23 files |
   | c  | 24px | Large elements (page containers) | 8 files |
   | d  | 16px sides, 16px bottom | Mobile bottom-fixed elements | 3 files |

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📋 CLARIFICATION REQUIRED

Please specify:
1. Which [thing]? (a/b/c from table above)
2. Which context? (a/b/c from table above)  
3. How to handle collision? (a/b/c/d from options above)
4. Which pattern to use? (a/b/c/d from table above)

Reply with: "1a, 2b, 3a, 4d" or provide detailed answers.

### Step 3: Wait for Clarification

**CRITICAL:** DO NOT PROCEED until human responds.

**Never:**
- ✗ "I'll assume you meant [X]..."
- ✗ "Let me know if this isn't right..." (after already doing it)
- ✗ "I picked the most likely one..."

**Always:**
- ✓ Wait for explicit clarification
- ✓ Present options clearly
- ✓ Make no changes until confirmed

---

### Step 4: Execute with Explicit Assumptions

After receiving clarification:

✓ CLARIFICATION RECEIVED

Proceeding with:
• Element: [specific element from clarification]
• Position: [specific context with exact values]
• Conflict resolution: [chosen strategy]
• Style values: [specific pattern with justification]

DETAILED PLAN:
1. Target element: src/components/Snackbar.tsx
2. Position: Mobile viewport (375px width)
   - bottom: 72px (clears 56px nav + 16px gap)
   - right: 16px (edge inset)
3. Padding: px-4 pb-4 (matches toast pattern from ToastNotification.tsx:23)
4. Z-index: 50 (below nav at 100, above content at 10)

Applying changes...

[Show actual code changes]

✓ COMPLETE

## Special Rules

### Rule A: "The [Thing]" Detection

AUTOMATIC SEARCH PROTOCOL

When instruction contains "the [thing]":

1. Search codebase for [thing]
2. Count results:
   • Found 0 → "I don't see a [thing]. Did you mean [similar thing]?"
   • Found 1 → Proceed (unique reference ✓)
   • Found 2+ → Trigger full disambiguation report

NEVER assume which one without clarification.

### Rule B: Spatial Terms Require Anchors

SPATIAL CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS

| ❌ Never Assume | ✅ Always Clarify |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "bottom right" = viewport | "Bottom-right of: (a) viewport (b) container (c) screen?" |
| "below" = immediately below | "Below [X]: (a) touching (b) with gap (c) just lower on page?" |
| "center" = page center | "Center of: (a) viewport (b) parent container (c) available space?" |

If instruction lacks anchor → Trigger disambiguation.

### Rule C: Style Inheritance Protocol

STYLE VALUE RESOLUTION

When style value is missing:

STEP 1: Search for existing pattern
• Same element type (e.g., other bottom-fixed elements)
• Same component family (e.g., other toasts/notifications)
• Design system tokens (if design-system.ts exists)

STEP 2: If multiple patterns found
→ List all options in disambiguation table
→ Wait for human to choose

STEP 3: If NO pattern found
→ Suggest value with clear rationale:
  "No existing pattern found for [thing].
   Suggestion: 16px (matches Tailwind default spacing-4)
   Alternatives: 12px (compact) or 20px (spacious)
   Which do you prefer?"

STEP 4: NEVER use arbitrary values
❌ Don't use: 15px, 18px, 22px, 14px (breaks spacing scales)
✅ Use only: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64 (standard scale)

### Rule D: Layout Collision Detection

COLLISION CHECK (Before placing ANY element)

1. Scan target position for existing elements
2. Check:
   • Position (fixed, absolute, sticky)
   • Z-index layers
   • Dimensions (will they overlap?)
   • Visibility conditions (always visible or conditional?)

3. If collision found:
   → Build conflict resolution options table
   → Present to human
   → Wait for decision

Example output:
"⚠️ COLLISION: Target position occupied by:
 • Bottom nav (fixed, z-100, 56px height, always visible)
 • Cookie banner (fixed, z-50, conditional)
 
 Options:
 a. Place above nav (bottom: 72px)
 b. Overlay nav (z-index: 101+)
 c. Alternative position (bottom-left instead)
 
 Which option?"
 
 # §V — COMBINED WORKFLOW

**Use when:** Request has BOTH large scope AND ambiguities.

**Example:**  
"Make all the green boxes use consistent padding and put them in the bottom right"

This has:
- Large scope: "all the green boxes" (could be 10+ instances)
- Ambiguity: "the green boxes" (which elements?), "padding" (what value?), "bottom right" (of what?)

---

## Combined Protocol

### Phase 1: Resolve Ambiguities FIRST

⚠️ COMBINED REQUEST DETECTED

This instruction contains:
☑ Large-scope work ("all the green boxes")
☑ Ambiguities (referential, spatial, implicit patterns)

PROTOCOL: Resolve ambiguities BEFORE building Concept Scaffold

Running §IV Ambiguity Resolution...

[Full disambiguation report for "the green boxes", "padding", "bottom right"]

Waiting for clarification before proceeding to large-scope work...

**Why this order?**  
You can't build a Concept Scaffold for "all X" if you don't know what "X" is yet.

### Phase 2: Build Concept Scaffold (After Clarification)

✓ AMBIGUITIES RESOLVED

Confirmed scope:
• "Green boxes" = Success notification toasts (bg-green-500)
• "Padding" = 16px (mobile toast pattern)
• "Bottom right" = Mobile viewport, above nav

Now proceeding to §III Large-Scope Protocol...

CONCEPT SCAFFOLD — Success Toast Positioning

[Build all 4 artifacts: Semantic Definition, Pattern Inventory, etc.]

Ready to scan for all instances?

### Phase 3: Execute Combined Changes

SCANNING for all success toast instances...

[Awareness Tracker updates]

Found 8 instances across 5 files

APPLYING STANDARDIZED CHANGES:
• Position: bottom: 72px, right: 16px (mobile viewport, above nav)
• Padding: px-4 pb-4 (16px sides/bottom, toast pattern)

Progress:
✓ 1/8 — src/components/SuccessToast.tsx — Updated
✓ 2/8 — src/app/checkout/success.tsx — Updated
...

Complete.

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER Do These)

### ❌ Large-Scope Anti-Patterns
- "I've updated the main instances..."
- "Fixed several boxes across the app..."
- "Updated most of the buttons..."
- Starting changes without building scaffold
- Declaring "done" without verification checklist

### ❌ Ambiguity Anti-Patterns
- "I'll assume you meant [X]..."
- "Let me know if this is wrong..." (after already doing it)
- "I picked the most common one..."
- Using arbitrary values (15px, 18px, 22px)
- Ignoring collisions at target position

### ✅ Correct Patterns
- "Found 23 instances. List attached. Confirm before proceeding."
- "Ambiguity detected. Which of these 4 options? [table]"
- "Using 16px (matches existing pattern in File.tsx:45)"
- "Collision detected at bottom-right. Resolution options: [list]"

## Trigger Phrases

| You Say | Claude Should Do |
|---------|------------------|
| "all boxes", "every button" | §III — Build Concept Scaffold |
| "the green box" (when multiple exist) | §IV-A — Referential disambiguation |
| "bottom right", "center" | §IV-B — Spatial disambiguation |
| "add padding", "make bigger" | §IV-C — Pattern inheritance |
| "make all boxes use consistent padding" | §V — Combined (ambiguity THEN scaffold) |

## Integration with Existing Skills

Add to your main **skills.md** or **Pre-Flight Checklist (§III)**:

### 6. ✓ Scope & Context Check
   Before any work, check:
   - Large-scope request? → SCOPE_AND_CONTEXT.md §III
   - Ambiguous instruction? → SCOPE_AND_CONTEXT.md §IV
   - Both? → SCOPE_AND_CONTEXT.md §V
   
   NEVER skip disambiguation or concept scaffolding.

## Examples in Action

### Example 1: Large-Scope Only
**You:** "Standardize all button styles"

**Claude:**

Large-scope detected → Using §III

CONCEPT SCAFFOLD — Buttons

1. SEMANTIC DEFINITION
   • Core purpose: Interactive elements that trigger actions
   • Visual signature: Clickable surface with label/icon
   • Functional signature: onClick handler, possibly disabled/loading
   • NOT included: Links styled as buttons (navigation, different semantic)

2. PATTERN INVENTORY
   Found 5 implementations:
   a. <Button> component (src/components/ui/Button.tsx)
   b. <button className="btn-primary"> (legacy)
   c. <button className="btn-secondary"> (legacy)
   d. Raw <button> with inline styles (very old files)
   e. <a className="btn-*"> (probably wrong, need review)

3. SCOPE BOUNDARIES
   INCLUDE: src/app/*, src/components/*
   EXCLUDE: src/emails/* (different context)
   EXPECTED: 40-80 instances

4. AWARENESS TRACKER
   Total files: 45
   
Ready to scan?

### Example 2: Ambiguity Only
**You:** "Move the modal to the center"

**Claude:**

Ambiguity detected → Using §IV

⚠️ DISAMBIGUATION REQUIRED

TYPE A — "the modal"
Found 3 modals:
| ID | Modal | State | Location |
|----|-------|-------|----------|
| a  | LoginModal | Hidden by default | src/components/LoginModal.tsx |
| b  | ConfirmDialog | Conditionally shown | src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx |
| c  | ImageLightbox | Photo viewer | src/components/ImageLightbox.tsx |

TYPE B — "center"
| ID | Context | Current State |
|----|---------|---------------|
| a  | Viewport center | Responsive to window size |
| b  | Content area center | Excludes sidebar |
| c  | Vertical + horizontal | True center |
| d  | Horizontal only | Top-aligned |

Which modal (a/b/c) and which centering (a/b/c/d)?

### Example 3: Combined
**You:** "Make all the green boxes use consistent padding and place them at the bottom right"

Phase 1: Resolving ambiguities FIRST...

⚠️ AMBIGUITY REPORT

TYPE A — "green boxes"
| ID | Element | Type | Location |
|----|---------|------|----------|
| a  | Success toast | Notification | Bottom-left currently |
| b  | Help tooltip | Floating | Context-dependent |
| c  | Debug panel | Dev tool | Bottom-right currently |

TYPE B — "bottom right"
| ID | Context | Occupants |
|----|---------|-----------|
| a  | Desktop viewport (1920px) | None |
| b  | Mobile viewport (375px) | Bottom nav (56px) |

TYPE C — "padding"
| ID | Pattern | Usage |
|----|---------|-------|
| a  | 8px | Small UI elements |
| b  | 16px | Mobile toasts |
| c  | 24px | Desktop cards |

Clarify: Which element (a/b/c), which viewport (a/b), which padding (a/b/c)?

**You:** "a, b, b"

**Claude:**

✓ Resolved:
• Element: Success toast
• Context: Mobile viewport (above nav)
• Padding: 16px (mobile toast pattern)

Phase 2: Building Concept Scaffold for all success toasts...

## Maintenance & Evolution

### When to Update This Skill

**Add new ambiguity types when you encounter:**
- Repeated misunderstandings in a new category
- Project-specific jargon that needs definition
- New layout paradigms (e.g., grid systems, flex patterns)

**Add new pattern examples when:**
- Your codebase introduces new component types
- You adopt new frameworks or libraries
- You establish new design system tokens

### Version History Template

## Summary

This skill solves two core problems:

**§III (Large-Scope)** → "Make all boxes the same"
- Forces explicit Concept Scaffold before scanning
- Maintains awareness across entire codebase
- Verifies completeness before execution

**§IV (Ambiguity Resolution)** → "Place the green box at bottom right with padding"
- Detects 3 types of ambiguity (referential, spatial, implicit)
- Builds disambiguation reports with options
- Waits for clarification before executing

**§V (Combined)** → Handles requests with both issues
- Resolves ambiguities FIRST
- Then builds scaffold for large-scope work

**Use this file** whenever Claude:
- Misses instances of "all X"
- Picks the wrong element from vague reference
- Uses random values instead of inheriting patterns
- Places things in wrong locations
- Declares "done" prematurely

Save this as `SCOPE_AND_CONTEXT.md` in your project root.
